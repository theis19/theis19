### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### My name is [Ivan Sebastian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivan-sebastian-3814121a0/), an Engineering Graduate with interest in data.

To get started, here are a list of my projects:
- [Sentiment Analysis on E-Commerce Review Data](https://github.com/theis19/Sentiment-Analysis-E-Commerce)
    
    This is my final project for my data science bootcamp at Purwadhika, I use NLTK package to analyze and process text data and create a sentiment prediction using a Naive Bayes Model.
- [Bank Deposit Classification](https://github.com/theis19/Bank-Deposit-Classification)
    
    This is a simple project I created during my free time. I analyzed bank customer data and use it to create a Random Forest Model to predict if a customer will deposit money.
- [Retail Banking Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/theis19/Retail-Banking-EDA)
    
    This is actually an assignment for a job interview I had, since I already spent time on it might as well showcase it here. This repository contains analysis technique I use to analyze the bank data.
    
And for recruiters if you're not convinced, kindly check my [Certification](https://github.com/theis19/Certification/tree/main/Certification) repository.
It contained certifications I achieved during my Data Science Journey, noteable ones are:
- [Telkomsel Tech Titans League Series 1 - Data Analytics](https://github.com/theis19/Certification/blob/main/Certification/Telkomsel%20Tech%20Titans/Certificate%20Telkomsel%20Tech%20Titans%20League%20-%20Series%20Data%20Analytics%20(Champion%20Titans).pdf) where I achieved Top 10 out of 749 participants, the competition consists of Python Coding, SQL, Statistics, and Machine Learning

- [Purwadhika Job Connector - Data Science and Machine Learning](https://github.com/theis19/Certification/blob/main/Certification/Purwadhika/Purwadhika%20-%20Certificate%20of%20Completion.jpg) certificate to prove I finished my data science bootcamp.
